# listmonk Ansible Role

![listmonk Logo](assets/listmonk.png)

listmonk is a self-hosted newsletter and mailing list manager. This role helps you to set up listmonk:

- with everything run in [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers
- powered by [the official listmonk container image](https://hub.docker.com/r/listmonk/listmonk/)

## Installing

To configure and install listmonk on your own server(s), you should use a playbook like [Mother of all self-hosting](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/mash-playbook) or write your own.
